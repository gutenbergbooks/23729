<h3>PREFACE.</h3>
<br />

<p>The following pages are presented to the medical public with
very humble pretensions. It is chiefly with the minor
accidents or diseases that they have to do; but I shall not
consider that I have laboured in vain, if I am enabled to
mitigate even these little evils of human life.</p>

<p>In these prefatory observations, however, I would suggest
the question whether the caustic may not be employed with
benefit even in some of the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>severer diseases to which the
human frame is liable. Indeed I consider the investigation
as only just begun, and many other uses of the lunar
caustic, besides those detailed in the following pages, have
suggested themselves to me.</p>

<p>May not the caustic, for instance, be of greater efficacy,
because of greater power and of quicker operation, than
ordinary blisters, in some internal diseases?</p>

<p>It is repeatedly stated hereafter, that the application of
the lunar caustic is a means, in certain circumstances, of
subduing external inflammation. Might it not, on this
principle, be of service in the treatment of some of the
internal phlegmasi&aelig;?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>It may be observed, that the lunar caustic may be regarded,
almost without further trial, as an effectual preventive of
those cases of irritative fever which arise from local
injuries, and probably of the effects of poisoned wounds in
general. I would not, however, in the latter cases, fail to
render "sure doubly sure" by free excision.</p>

<p>Might not an adherent eschar be easily formed in those cases
of compound fracture in which the external wound is of
moderate size, so as effectually to exclude the external air
and prevent cutaneous inflammation, and in more respects
than one, to reduce the case to the state of a simple
fracture? This object, if attained, would be important
indeed, and I hope the suggestion will <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>be submitted to the
most assiduous and cautious trial.</p>

<p>I can have no doubt that the use of the lunar caustic admits
of being still further extended; and, as I intend to pursue
the inquiry, I hope at some future period to publish
something more worthy of the attention of the medical
public. In the mean time, the plans hereafter suggested must
not be adopted without that degree of care, attention, and
perseverance, which are obviously necessary to render them
successful.</p>

<h4>ON HEALING BY ESCHAR.</h4>
<br />


<p>Having been led, by several circumstances, to try the
effects of the Lunar Caustic in the treatment of Wounds and
Ulcers, and having great reason, from these trials, to think
that this remedy may be used with much advantage far more
extensively than has hitherto been done, I lay the results
of my experience before my medical brethren.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>A very natural mode of healing certain wounds and ulcers, is
by scabbing; but this mode of treatment is attended by many
disadvantages, as will be pointed out shortly; yet it may be
supposed to have suggested to me some of those trials of the
treatment by eschar, which I am about to detail.</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span><br />

<h4>I. ON THE ADHERENT ESCHAR.</h4>

<p>It appears scarcely necessary to describe the immediate and
well known effects of the application of the lunar caustic
to the surface of a wound or ulcer. It may, however, be
shortly observed that the contact of the caustic induces, at
first, a white film or eschar which, when exposed to the
air, assumes in a few hours a darker colour, and at a later
period, becomes black; as the eschar undergoes these changes
of colour it gradually becomes harder and resembles a bit of
sticking plaster; in the course of a few days, according to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>the size and state of the wound, the eschar becomes
corrugated and begins to separate at its edges, and at
length peels off altogether, leaving the surface of the sore
underneath, in a healed state.</p>

<p>In the formation of this eschar several things require
particular attention. The application of the caustic should
be made over the whole surface of the sore; and indeed no
part requires so much attention as the edges; to make a
firmer eschar the caustic should even be applied beyond the
edge of the wound, upon the surrounding skin, for the eschar
in drying is apt to contract a little, and in this manner
may leave a <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>space between its edges and that of the
adjacent healthy skin.</p>

<p>At the same time, much attention must be paid to the degree
in which the caustic is applied. In cases of recent wounds
unattended by inflammation, it may be applied freely; but
when inflammation has come on, too severe an application of
the caustic induces vesication of the surrounding skin, and
the edges of the eschar may in this manner also be loosened
and removed. If every part is touched, a slight application
of the caustic is generally sufficient.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>The importance of avoiding all causes which might detach the
edges of the eschar will be apprehended by the following
interesting observation, which I have been enabled to deduce
from very extensive trials of the caustic; it is, that, in
every instance in which the eschar remains adherent from the
first application, the wound or ulcer over which it is
formed, invariably heals.</p>

<p>Not only the cause just mentioned, but every other by which
the eschar might be disturbed, must, therefore, be carefully
avoided; and especially, as the eschar begins to separate
from the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>healed edges of the sore, it should be carefully
removed by a pair of scissors.</p>

<p>To the surface of the wound the eschar supplies a complete
protection and defence, and allows the healing process to go
on underneath uninterruptedly and undisturbed. It renders
all applications, such as plasters, totally unnecessary, as
well as the repeated dressings to which recourse is usually
had in such cases; and it at once removes the soreness
necessarily attendant on an ulcerated surface being exposed
to the open air. In many cases too, in which the patients
are usually rendered incapable of following their wonted
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>avocations, this mode of treatment saves them from an
inconvenience, which is, to some, of no trifling nature.</p>

<p>It has already been stated how important it is that the
eschar should be preserved adherent. To secure this still
more effectually, I have found it of great utility to
protect it by a portion of gold-beater's skin. The skin
surrounding the wound is simply moistened with a drop of
water, and the gold-beater's skin is then to be applied over
it and over the eschar, to which it soon adheres firmly, but
from which it may be removed at any time, by again
moistening it for a moment with water; the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>same bit of
gold-beater's skin admits of being again and again reapplied
in the same manner.</p>

<p>The other circumstances which render the eschar unadherent
will be mentioned hereafter. In the mean time the fact
stated <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><a href="#Page_6">p. 6</a>,</span> will sufficiently establish the propriety of
treating distinctly of the adherent eschar.</p>

<p>I now proceed to mention some other effects of the
application of the caustic. The first is that, in cases in
which there would be much and long continued irritability
and pain, as in superficial wounds along the shin, all this
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>suffering, and its consequences in disabling the patient,
are completely avoided. A blush of inflammation forms around
the eschar, but this gradually subsides without any
disagreeable consequences, and the inflammation which would
otherwise have been set up is entirely prevented by the due
formation of the eschar.</p>

<p>If inflammation be previously established, it is increased,
at first, by the application of the caustic. But if this
inflammation be not severe, and if the eschar remain
adherent, all inflammation, both that induced by the
application of the caustic, and that existing <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>previously,
entirely subsides. When the previous inflammation round the
ulcer is considerable, however, the application of the
caustic would induce vesication, and it should in such a
case of course be avoided, and another mode of treatment to
be described hereafter must be adopted.</p>

<p>I would introduce in this place some observations on the
comparative effects of healing by eschar and by scabbing. On
the subject of scabbing I must refer my reader to the well
known work of Mr. John Hunter. The advantage of healing by
eschar over that by scabbing is quite decided. By
comparative trials, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>I have found that whilst the scab is
irritable and painful, and surrounded by a ring of
inflammation, the adherent eschar is totally free from pain
and inflammation; and that whilst the scab remains attended
by inflammation and unhealed, the eschar is gradually
separating, leaving the surface underneath completely
healed. To these observations I may add that the success of
the plan of healing by eschar is infinitely more certain as
well as more speedy than that by scabbing.</p>

<p>I shall, in conclusion, briefly recapitulate the advantages
of this mode of treatment. In the first place, it will be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>found far more efficacious and speedy than any other;
secondly, it has the great advantage of saving the patient
much suffering and inconvenience; and thirdly, it renders
the repeated application of dressings and ointments quite
unnecessary. Its utility is extremely great, therefore,
where the time of the poor, the expense of an establishment,
and the labours of the medical officer, as well as the
sufferings of the patient, require to be considered; and it
will I imagine be found of no little advantage, in all these
respects, in many cases which are incident to the soldier
and sailor.</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span><br />

<h4>II. ON THE UNADHERENT ESCHAR.</h4>

<p>The eschar is generally adherent in cases of recent
injuries, and in small ulcers, when they are nearly even
with the skin and attended by little inflammation. In other
cases the eschar is too apt to be unadherent, and this
arises from the formation of pus or of a scab underneath.</p>

<p>If the eschar be unadherent by subjacent pus, it may be
ascertained in the space of from twelve to twenty-four
hours; the centre is generally observed to be raised and to
yield to the pressure <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>of a probe; sometimes the subjacent
fluid has partly escaped by an opening at the side of the
eschar.</p>

<p>When a scab forms underneath the eschar, which does not
happen except the fluid has been allowed to remain too long
under the eschar without being evacuated, there are pain and
some inflammation, the eschar does not separate, but remains
long over the sore, and there is no appearance of healing.</p>

<p>When it is ascertained that there is fluid underneath the
eschar, a slight puncture is to be made by the point of a
penknife, the fluid is to be gently <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>pressed out, and the
caustic is then to be applied to the orifice thus made. The
same plan is to be adopted if the fluid ooze out at the edge
of the eschar; it is to be fully evacuated by pressure, and
the orifice is to be touched with the caustic. The healing
process goes on best however when the orifice is in the
centre of the eschar. After this treatment the eschar
occasionally remains adherent, but more frequently the fluid
requires to be evacuated repeatedly, and this should be done
every twelve hours, or once a day, according to the quantity
of fluid formed, taking care that the eschar be not
needlessly separated by allowing the fluid to accumulate
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>underneath. If, from accident, the eschar is separated
before the sore be healed I would reapply the caustic. At
length the eschar becomes adherent, and in due time begins
to peel off, leaving the surface healed.</p>

<p>In every case in which the eschar does not separate
favourably, I begin to suspect the formation of a scab
underneath, in which case the whole must be removed by the
application of a cold poultice for two or three days; this
has not only the effect of removing the eschar but of
allaying any inflammation or irritation; afterwards the
caustic must be reapplied as before.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>The gold-beater's skin is more useful as a protection to the
unadherent than to the adherent eschar, as the former would
be more liable to be torn off by accident than the latter.
The gold-beater's skin must be removed in the manner already
described, whenever the subjacent fluid is to be evacuated,
and must be reapplied after touching the orifice with
caustic.</p>

<p>The pain experienced on the application of the caustic is
greater or less according to the sensibility and size of the
wound. In small wounds it is trifling, and of short
duration; it is more severe in recent wounds than in
ulcers; <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>it soon subsides in every case, and then the
patient enjoys greater ease than would be experienced under
any other mode of treatment. Little or no pain is caused on
applying the caustic after evacuating the subjacent fluid of
an unadherent eschar. Altogether the pain inflicted by the
caustic is far less than is generally imagined, and forms
scarcely an obstacle to its employment.</p>

<p>It may be proper, in this place, to notice such
circumstances as render the employment of the caustic
improper or inefficient. It is improper to employ the
caustic when the ulcer is too large to admit of the
formation of a complete <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>eschar; or when it is so situated
as to render it impossible that the eschar should remain
undisturbed, as between the toes, unless, indeed, the
patient be confined to his bed;&mdash;or in cases attended by
much inflammation, or by much &oelig;dema.</p>

<p>I have found no kind of caustic so manageable as the lunar
caustic; and this is best applied in the solid form. I have
thought too, that the newly prepared lunar caustic is more
apt to dissolve on being applied than that which has been
longer made and more exposed to the air; the latter is
therefore to be preferred.</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span><br />

<h4>III. ON THE TREATMENT BY ESCHAR AND POULTICE.</h4>

<p>In many cases in which it is impossible to adopt either the
mode of treatment by the adherent or the unadherent eschar,
it is of great utility to apply the caustic first and then a
cold poultice made without lard or oil: this plan is
particularly useful in cases of punctured wounds attended by
much pain and swelling, and in cases of recently opened
abscesses. By this application the pain and swelling are
much subdued and a free issue is secured for the secreted
fluid; and in no case have I seen the original inflammation
increased by it.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>It is generally necessary to repeat the application of the
caustic every second or third day, or every day if the
inflammation and swelling of the part be considerable, and
the cold poultice may be renewed about every eight hours. At
length, however, the inflammation having subsided, the
attempt may be made to form an adherent eschar.</p>

<p>I have seen many cases, in which, by this mode of treatment,
much suffering and perhaps the loss of some of the smaller
joints have been prevented, particularly cases of deep
seated inflammation of the fingers, which, having <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>been
neglected, have issued in severe inflammation, abscess, and
terrible fungous growths. In these cases it is not only
necessary to apply the caustic to the surface of the sore,
but in every cavity or orifice which may be formed by the
disease.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II.<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">ToC</a></span></h3>

<h4>ON THE APPLICATION OF THESE MODES OF TREATMENT TO PARTICULAR
CASES.</h4>

<br />

<h4>I. OF PUNCTURES ETC.</h4>

<p>In cases of recent punctured wounds the orifice and
surrounding skin should be moistened with a drop of water;
the caustic should then be applied within the puncture until
a little pain be felt, and then over the surrounding skin,
and the eschar must be allowed to dry. In this manner it is
astonishing how <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>completely the terrible effects of a
punctured wound are prevented; the eschar usually remains
adherent, and the case requires no further attention.</p>

<p>At a later period after the accident, when the caustic has
been neglected, some degree of inflammation is usually
present, the orifice is nearly closed with the swelling, and
a little pus or fluid is formed within. A slight pressure
will evacuate this fluid, the caustic may then be applied
within the puncture, and over the surrounding skin, beyond
the inflammation, and must be allowed to dry. In this manner
we frequently succeed in forming an adherent eschar, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>all inflammation subsides. Any slight vesication which may
be raised around punctured wounds is not of the same
consequence as when an adherent eschar is wished to be
formed over a sore or ulcer; one or more small punctures may
be made to evacuate the fluid and the part may be allowed to
dry.</p>

<p>If there is reason to think that an abscess has actually
formed under the puncture to any extent, it must be opened
freely by a lancet and treated with caustic and poultice,
keeping the poultice moist and cold with water.</p>

<p>In cases of puncture where the orifice is healed and where
an <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>erysipelatous inflammation is spreading, attended with
swelling, I have applied the caustic freely over and beyond
the inflamed parts, and I have had the satisfaction to find
that the inflammation has been arrested in its progress and
has shortly subsided.</p>

<p>This mode of treatment is particularly useful in cases of
punctured and lacerated wounds from various instruments,
such as needles, nails, hooks, bayonets, saws, &amp;c. and in
the bites of animals, leech-bites, stings of insects, &amp;c. In
considerable lacerations the same objection would exist to
this treatment as in large ulcers.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>The dreadful effects of punctures from needles, scratches
from bone, or other injuries received in dissection, are
totally prevented by this treatment. I have for the last
five years had frequent opportunities of trying it in these
cases and have the most perfect confidence in its success.</p>

<p>The advantage of these modes of treating punctured wounds
will however be best explained and established by a
selection of cases, to which I can add particular remarks as
they may be suggested by peculiarities in the cases
themselves.</p>

<br />

<h4 class="sc"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>Case I.</h4>

<p>A.B. received a severe punctured wound by a hook of the size
of a crow-quill, which pierced into the flesh between the
thumb and fore-finger on the outside of the hand; scarcely a
drop of blood followed, but there was immediately severe
pain and tumefaction. The lunar caustic was applied without
loss of time, deep within the orifice and around the edge of
the wound; and the eschar was left to dry. The smarting pain
induced by the caustic was severe for a time but gradually
subsided.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>On the ensuing day, the eschar was adherent and there was
little pain; but there was more swelling than usual after
the prompt application of the caustic, owing to the mobility
of the part.</p>

<p>On the third day the swelling remained as before, and there
was a little sense of heat. On the fourth day the swelling
and heat had subsided, and the eschar remained adherent. On
the succeeding day the eschar had been removed by washing
the hand, and the puncture was unhealed but free from pain
and irritation. The caustic was reapplied.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>From this time the eschar remained adherent, and at length
gradually separated leaving the part perfectly well.</p>

<p>It is quite certain that under any other mode of treatment
this severe puncture would have greatly inflamed and have
proved very painful and troublesome; and it is not
improbable but that suppuration and much suffering might
have ensued. All this is effectually and almost certainly
prevented if the caustic be applied promptly, as in this
case. When time has been lost, the case is very different as
will appear hereafter; but even in these cases, the caustic
proves an invaluable application.</p>

<br />

<h4 class="sc"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>Case II.</h4>

<p>Mrs. Middleton, aged 40, wounded her wrist, on the ulnar
side, by the hook of a door post; there was a considerable
flow of blood at first, but this ceased suddenly and the arm
immediately became affected with great pain and swelling.
The lunar caustic was applied in half an hour after the
accident.</p>

<p>On the following day the eschar was observed to be adherent,
and the patient reported that she had suffered scarcely any
pain, after the smarting of the caustic had ceased. There
was a slight <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>swelling round the puncture but that of the
arm had totally subsided. The caustic was applied over and
beyond the swelling. On the third day all tumefaction had
subsided and there was no complaint whatever.</p>

<p>I hoped that this case would have required no further
attention or remedy. But my patient contrived unfortunately
to rub off the eschar about a week after its formation, and
so to expose the subjacent wound unhealed; she suffered
however no pain or inconvenience from it; and it was again
shielded by means of a fresh eschar, which remained adherent
until removed by the healing process underneath.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>This puncture was so severe that the arm was in a state of
ecchymosis for six or eight inches upwards, and I doubt not
that without the caustic, there would have been severe and
long continued suffering, and perhaps painful suppurations.</p>

<br />

<h4 class="sc">Case III.</h4>

<p>A female servant punctured the end of the finger by a pin;
there succeeded much pain and swelling, and it appeared that
the nail would separate, and the cuticle all round the
finger was raised by the effusion of fluid. This fluid was
evacuated and a poultice applied.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>On the third day the cuticle was removed, and the exposed
surface was found to be ulcerated in several spots. The
lunar caustic was passed slightly over the excoriated
surface, which was then left exposed to dry.</p>

<p>On the succeeding day the eschar was adherent and the pain
had almost subsided. On the next day, the eschar still
remained adherent, and as there was neither pain nor
soreness, the patient used her finger.</p>

<p>The eschar was at length removed by the healing process and
was separated together with the nail, and the case <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>was
unattended by any further inconvenience or trouble either to
the patient or myself.</p>

<p>It is scarcely necessary to contrast the advantage of this
mode of treatment with that by plasters, poultices, &amp;c. It
is at once more speedy and secure, and less cumbersome to
such patients as are obliged to continue domestic
avocations.</p>

<br />

<h4 class="sc">Case IV.</h4>

<p>The present case is somewhat more severe than those which
have been already given, and what is of great <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>importance,
the caustic was not applied immediately after the accident.</p>

<p>William Chantry, aged 50, received a stab in the wrist with
a hay-fork yesterday and applied a poultice; to-day there
are great pain and swelling, and the wounded orifice is very
small. I applied the lunar caustic within the puncture, and
directly a cold poultice to be worn over it; the arm was
kept in a sling.</p>

<p>The next day the swelling and pain were diminished, and a
little lymph flowed from the wound. I again applied the
caustic and continued the poultice.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>Two days afterwards, the swelling and pain were nearly gone.
The poultice was merely continued, the caustic not being
requisite from the subsidence of the inflammation. The
patient came to me again in four days more quite free from
pain and swelling. The poultice was discontinued, and the
caustic was then applied in order to form an adherent
eschar, in which I was successful.</p>

<p>This case illustrates many important points; 1. it shows the
efficacy of the caustic with the poultice as a remedy
against inflammation; 2. it presents an instance of a
labouring man returning to work on the sixth or seventh day
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>after a severe accident, even when the application of the
caustic had been unfortunately delayed; 3. it points out the
proper treatment, when all hope of the treatment from the
first by adherent eschar is lost from such delay,&mdash;for had
this been attempted in this case, suppuration would
doubtless have taken place from the closed state of the
puncture by the swelling;&mdash;our objects must therefore be, to
open the puncture and to subdue the inflammation, and these
objects are admirably attained by means of the caustic.</p>

<p>The following case is not less instructive.</p>

<br />

<h4 class="sc"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>Case V.</h4>

<p>Mr. Cocking's son, aged 12, received a stab in the palm of
the hand from a penknife three days ago, which has been
followed by much swelling and pain, the punctured orifice
being nearly closed. I applied the lunar caustic as deep as
possible within the puncture and directed a cold poultice to
be laid over the whole hand.</p>

<p>On the next day I found that the poultice had not been
applied; there were more pain and swelling; an eschar was
formed over the puncture which I <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>removed and thus gave
issue to a considerable quantity of pus; I again enjoined
the application of a cold poultice kept constantly moist and
cold with water.</p>

<p>On the succeeding day, the inflammation had greatly
subsided. I repeated the application of the caustic and
poultice. On the fourth day the inflammation had nearly
disappeared and on the fifth entirely.</p>

<p>In such cases the caustic unites the advantages of at once
opening the puncture and of subduing the inflammation, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>thus
preventing the formation of deep-seated abscesses.</p>

<br />

<h4 class="sc">Case VI.</h4>

<p>A little boy, aged 12, received a stab by a penknife a few
days ago, in the fore part of the thigh; there are now great
pain and swelling, the orifice is nearly closed, and he has
feverishness with headach. I applied the lunar caustic
deeply in the wound, and directed a poultice and a cold
lotion to be kept upon the inflamed parts; and suspecting
fascial inflammation, I took away ten ounces of blood and
administered purgative medicine.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>On the next day, the inflammation had greatly subsided; the
cataplasm and lotion were continued.</p>

<p>On the third day, there was some inflammation round the
puncture which appeared to be closing; I repeated the
application of the caustic within the orifice of the wound.</p>

<p>On the fourth day the swelling was subsiding and there was
no pain. The poultice and lotion were continued.&mdash;From this
time there was no occasion for any remedy, and the little
patient speedily recovered.</p>

<br />

<h4 class="sc"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>Case VII.</h4>

<p>Mr. Parr, aged 30, of delicate habit, trod upon a needle
which pierced the ball of the great toe; a free crucial
incision was made but the needle could not be found; a
poultice was applied to the wound and over the poultice a
cold lotion.</p>

<p>In the course of a week part of the needle came away. He did
not rest as he was enjoined to do, and, in consequence,
severe inflammation came on, and in two days time,
fluctuation was perceived over the joint, opposite to <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>the
puncture; a free incision was made, and some pus was
evacuated.</p>

<p>On the following day there was a free discharge, but very
considerable inflammation had taken place on the side of the
ball of the toe; a free incision was made in this part, and
a fresh quantity of pus was evacuated.</p>

<p>On the succeeding day, the inflammation was somewhat abated;
but on the next day, it had again become exasperated, and
the openings made for the evacuation of matter were somewhat
closed by the swelling. I now introduced the lunar caustic
very freely into <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>these openings, and reapplied a cold
poultice and lotion.</p>

<p>On the following day, I found that my patient had slept well
for the first time since the developement of inflammation,
and had suffered far less, after the smarting pain from the
application of the caustic had subsided, than before; the
punctured orifices were open, and the skin, which was
extremely tense the day before, was become soft and
flexible.</p>

<p>From this time, I found nothing necessary but to repeat the
application of the caustic about every third day to <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>subdue
inflammation and to keep the wounds open, which it always
effected. The joint ever afterwards remained stiff, from
which we may infer the violence of the inflammation; and
when we consider what was the constitution of my patient, we
cannot, I think, doubt that the caustic prevented many
serious events usually consequent in such cases under the
ordinary treatment.</p>

<p>It is highly worthy of remark, that the good effects of the
application of the caustic, in this case, were too immediate
and distinct to be mistaken.</p>

<br />

<h4 class="sc"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>Case VIII.</h4>

<p>This case illustrates the mode of treatment by the lunar
caustic, of those terrible effects of punctured wounds which
have been neglected in the beginning.</p>

<p>B. Unwin, aged 40, washerwoman, applied to me on July the
10th, 1820, with severe inflammation and ulceration of the
middle finger, arising from a puncture by a pin or needle
some time before; there was much painful tumefaction, and
the integuments had burst along nearly half of the length of
the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>finger, on the ulnar side, and over the middle joint on
the radial side; the probe did not however pass to the bone
or into the joint. I applied the lunar caustic deep in every
part, and over the whole surface, and enveloped the finger
in a cold poultice covered with cold water.</p>

<p>On the 11th she reported that she had slept well for the
first time during the last fortnight; to-day there is
scarcely any pain, but she complains of soreness; the
swelling has greatly subsided. The caustic was again applied
and the poultice and lotion continued.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>On the 12th there were still swelling and pain; there was
considerable bleeding from the wound, so that I could not
apply the caustic well.</p>

<p>On the 13th the swelling and pain were nearly gone. I
repeated the caustic which induced bleeding from the fungous
flesh.</p>

<p>On the 14th the swelling had nearly subsided; the cuticle
was separating all over the finger. The lunar caustic was
applied extensively over the wound and abraded parts and
induced little bleeding or pain.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>On the 15th the fungous was nearly removed; the wound
presented an appearance of slough over its surface.&mdash;The
caustic was applied to the remaining fungous.</p>

<p>On the 17th the wound was much smaller and the slough
separating. The caustic and cataplasm were applied as
before.&mdash;A similar report was made on the succeeding day.</p>

<p>On the 20th the slough was separating. The caustic and
cataplasm were applied.&mdash;A similar report was made on the
22d.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>On the 24th the slough having separated the integuments over
it were flabby and loose; the caustic was applied to them.</p>

<p>By a continuation of this plan the wound gradually
contracted, and, at length, when there was no further use
for the cataplasm, the eschar became adherent and the sore
healed underneath. It appeared highly probable to me that,
under ordinary treatment, the finger, in this case, would
have been lost.</p>

<br />
<hr style='width: 15%;' />
<br />

<p>I shall in this place, introduce a few observations on
wounds received during dissection.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>It is not in my power to give any cases in illustration of
the treatment of the severer accidents resulting from these
wounds; for since I began the free use of the lunar caustic
all the terrible effects of such wounds have been invariably
prevented.</p>

<p>I may here mention that in the years 1813 and 1819,
respectively, I was myself exposed to great danger from
inoculation during the examination of dead bodies. Since the
latter period I have repeatedly been exposed to the same
danger from inoculation, but in every instance, the danger
has been completely averted by the prompt and free
application of the lunar caustic.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>The following is the exact mode of treatment which I would
adopt in such cases.</p>

<p>In recent punctures the caustic should be applied in the
manner already described in cases of simple punctured
wounds.</p>

<p>When the case has been neglected, a small tumour is usually
formed underneath the skin with smart stinging pain; this
tumour should be removed entirely by the lancet, and the
caustic should be applied, both to the surface of the wound
and over the surrounding skin, to form an adherent eschar.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>When the case has been still longer neglected, and
inflammation of the absorbents has supervened, a free
crucial incision is to be made, the caustic is to be very
freely applied, and afterwards a cold poultice and lotion,
the usual constitutional remedies being actively enforced.</p>

<br />
<hr style='width: 15%;' />
<br />

<p>In connexion with punctured wounds I here subjoin several
cases of the bites of animals.</p>

<br />

<h4 class="sc">Case IX.</h4>

<p>James Joynes, aged 12, was bitten by an ass, on each side of
the middle <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>finger; the wounds were severe, and almost
immediately followed by swelling and great pain. The lunar
caustic was well applied within half an hour after the
accident.</p>

<p>On the succeeding day, the eschar was found to be quite
adherent, and the pain and swelling had subsided.</p>

<p>The eschar separated in about twelve days and the wounds
were healed.</p>

<br />

<h4 class="sc">Case X.</h4>

<p>Mr. Worth's daughter, aged six, was thrown down by a dog and
bitten <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>severely on the face and forehead in three places;
one of the wounds in the cheek was deep from the penetration
of the dog's front teeth, and the parts were much bruised.
The lunar caustic was well applied in half an hour after the
accident to each of the wounds, and the eschar was covered
with gold-beater's skin.</p>

<p>On the next day the eschars were adherent. There was some
swelling from the severity of the bruise; but the child made
little complaint.</p>

<p>On the third day, the swelling remained as before and the
eschar <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>adherent. On the fourth, the swelling had nearly
disappeared.&mdash;The eschar separated in nine days from the
infliction of the wound, leaving the parts healed and free
from scar.</p>

<br />

<h4 class="sc">Case XI.</h4>

<p>Mrs. G. was bitten by a little dog on forefinger about a
fortnight ago. There is now a very irritable, inflamed,
fungous sore. I removed the fungous by a pair of scissors
and applied the lunar caustic to form an eschar.</p>

<p>On the succeeding day, I found that the patient had applied
a little lint <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>before the eschar was dry, which had
prevented it from remaining adherent. I reapplied the
caustic and desired that the eschar might be exposed to dry.</p>

<p>The eschar remained adherent, the inflammation subsided and
the case gave no further trouble.</p>

<br />

<h4 class="sc">Case XII.</h4>

<p>A servant maid was bitten by a dog in four places&mdash;severely
on the forearm&mdash;three days ago. Adhesive plaster had been
applied. There is a wound across the arm two inches in
length and three-fourths of an inch in breadth, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>attended by
dull pain, and swelling of the arm. I applied the caustic to
form an eschar, covering it with goldbeater's skin.</p>

<p>On the following day the eschar remained adherent round the
edges, but had a puffy feel in the centre; I pierced it with
a penknife and a little bloody fluid escaped, and I touched
the orifice thus made with the caustic. The swelling
remained as before, with a degree of soreness.</p>

<p>On the next day the swelling had subsided. The eschar had
the same character; a little fluid was again <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>evacuated and
the caustic applied to the orifice as before.</p>

<p>This mode of treatment was pursued for nine successive days
when the eschar remained adherent in every part.</p>

<p>This patient continued her usual avocations all along. Under
any other plan of treatment I think it impossible that she
should not have been compelled to rest for a number of days.</p>

<p>Adherent eschars were formed on the other three bites which
were less severe, from the first application.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>A very irritable sore sometimes forms after the application
of leeches. I knew one lady who was confined during five
weeks with several sores on her foot from such a case. I
have no doubt that the application of the caustic would have
prevented all the inconvenience and suffering she
experienced. This observation will be confirmed by the
following case.</p>

<br />

<h4 class="sc">Case XIII.</h4>

<p>Am old man applied leeches to the instep for inflammation
occasioned by a bruise. Several very irritable sores were
produced with some swelling. I <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>applied the lunar caustic to
form an eschar.</p>

<p>On the following day, the eschars were adherent, the
swelling had subsided, and he had slept well for the first
time of several nights.</p>

<p>I do not, however, think the lunar caustic would succeed in
such cases if attended by great inflammation, without the
previous application of a cold poultice with rest for a day
or two.</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span><br />

<h4>II. ON BRUISES.</h4>

<p>It has been already observed, <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><a href="#Page_9">p. 9</a>,</span> that the caustic is an
invaluable remedy in cases of bruised wounds of the shin. In
these, as in all other cases, the value of this remedy is
greatly enhanced by an early application. In bruises on the
shin I have not had a single instance in which I was not
enabled to effect a cure by the adherent eschar, if
application was made to me early. The difficulty of forming
an adherent eschar is always increased by delay; but in
these bruises along the shin there is an additional reason
for this increased difficulty, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>arising out of the tendency
observed in them, to the formation of a slough.</p>

<p>In this place I have, indeed, to make an observation of
particular interest, both in a pathological and curative
point of view; it is, that the formation of this slough has
always been prevented by an early application of the
caustic, in the cases which have hitherto fallen under my
care. This fact may probably admit of explanation in the
following manner; the bruise partially destroys the
organization of the part, and the subsequent inflammation
completing what the injury had partially effected, a loss of
vitality takes place, and the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>slough is formed. The early
application of the caustic has already been shown to have
the remarkable effect of preventing the inflammation
consequent upon certain wounds, and thus the part is
suffered to recover from the injury done to its
organization, and its vitality is preserved.</p>

<p>Whether this mode of explaining the fact be correct or no,
the fact itself is extremely important, for the formation of
a slough, which the early application of the caustic can
alone prevent, renders it quite impossible to effect the
formation of an adherent eschar.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>When the patient applies too late after the accident to
prevent the formation of a slough we must still treat the
case by the caustic. It is to be applied over the bruised
and inflamed part. The eschar remains adherent round the
part occupied by the slough and prevents or moderates the
inflammation, and when the slough separates an eschar is to
be formed over the exposed sore.</p>

<p>In the neglected and severer cases of bruise attended by
much inflammation, it will be found best to treat the part
for a day or two by a cold poultice to give time for the
inflammation to subside; otherwise the caustic might <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>induce
vesication of the skin, as I have mentioned already, <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><a href="#Page_5">p. 5</a>,</span>
and the eschar could not be adherent.</p>

<br />

<h4 class="sc">Case XIV.</h4>

<p>The first case of bruise which I shall detail was not
severe, but will serve to illustrate the mode of treatment
by the adherent eschar.</p>

<p>Mr. Symons, aged 60, slipped off a chair and bruised the
shin, last evening; the skin was removed to the extent of an
inch in one part and a square inch in another. He applied a
common poultice. During the night he had much <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>pain, and
to-day there is much inflammation round the wounds. I
applied the lunar caustic over both wounds and covered the
eschar with gold-beater's skin to prevent the contact of the
stocking.</p>

<p>On the following day the eschar was found to be perfect. The
pain had entirely ceased. There was a little vesication
round one of the wounds. I simply evacuated the fluid of the
vesication and left the part exposed to dry.</p>

<p>On the third day there was no pain or inflammation, and the
eschar remained adherent.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>From this time no remedy was required. The eschar separated
leaving the surface healed, in about a month from the
occurrence of the accident. The patient suffered no sort of
inconvenience nor was he confined from his labours a single
day.</p>

<br />

<h4 class="sc">Case XV.</h4>

<p>The following case was far more severe, but the mode of
treatment was not less efficacious.</p>

<p>Mr. Granger, aged 36, was exposed to a severe bruise by a
great weight of stones which had been piled up, falling
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>upon the outside of the leg; he was extricated from this
situation with much difficulty. Besides the bruise, the skin
was removed from the outside of the leg to the extent of ten
or twelve inches in length, and in some parts an inch and
half in breadth; and in the forepart of the ankle a deep
furrow was made by the rough edge of one of the stones. I
applied the caustic in about half an hour after the
accident, over the whole surface of the wounds, and
protected the eschar by the gold-beater's skin. The patient
was directed to keep the leg cool and exposed to the air. He
took no medicine.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>On the succeeding day the leg was a little swelled, but the
patient did not complain of any acute pain but only of a
sense of stiffness. An adherent and perfect eschar was found
to be formed over the whole extent of the wound. There was
no fever.</p>

<p>On the third day, the swelling had abated. No further
remedy. The patient was still enjoined to rest.</p>

<p>On the fourth day the swelling was nearly gone. The eschar
remained adherent. The patient walks about.</p>

<p>From this time the patient pursued his avocation of a
stone-mason; no <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>further remedy was required; no
inconvenience experienced; and the eschar separated in about
a month.</p>

<p>I think it totally impossible to have cured this wound, by
any other remedy, in less than a month; during which period
the patient must have suffered much pain and fever, and have
been quite confined.</p>

<p>It is also quite certain, I think, that there would have
been an extensive slough, from the severity of the bruise.
This was doubtless prevented by the application of the
caustic.</p>

<br />

<h4 class="sc"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>Case XVI.</h4>

<p>J. Jennings, bricklayer, aged 26, fell through the roof of a
house and bruised and lacerated his shin rather severely to
the extent of an inch and half in one part and in several
other places in a less degree. I applied the lunar caustic
to the wound immediately.</p>

<p>On the following day the eschar was found to be adherent,
and there was neither pain nor swelling.</p>

<p>The eschars separated in nine days leaving the wounds
healed.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>It is remarkable that the eschar remains a greater or less
time over the wound according to the severity and exigency
of the case. This case being less severe than the former one
the eschar remained upon the wound during a much shorter
period of time.</p>

<br />

<h4 class="sc">Case XVII.</h4>

<p>An old man, aged 60, received a bruise upon the occiput from
a fall; the skin was lacerated and removed to the extent of
half-a-crown. I applied the lunar caustic soon after the
accident.</p>

<p>On the next day an adherent eschar was formed. There was
neither pain <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>nor swelling.&mdash;The eschar separated in a
fortnight.</p>

<br />

<h4 class="sc">Case XVIII.</h4>

<p>Mrs. C. aged 40, was detained on a journey by a bruised
wound on her knee, received a fortnight before, which was
healing very slowly under the usual mode of treatment. The
inflammation was subsiding but the sore was extremely
irritable and painful, and she was prevented from moving.
From the degree of inflammation still present, I applied the
lunar caustic very slightly over the sore and not over the
inflamed skin; I left the eschar to dry, but was <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>very
doubtful, from the same cause, whether it would be adherent
or no.</p>

<p>On the succeeding day I found that the eschar did remain
adherent and that the inflammation was diminished, and the
soreness had entirely subsided after that induced by the
caustic had ceased.</p>

<p>On the next day, the lameness was gone, and there was no
sort of inconvenience from the wound. My patient continued
her journey on the following day, so that I do not know when
the eschar separated.</p>

<p>In regard to the inflammation attendant on these wounds, I
would <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>remark that slight inflammation is relieved by the
application of the lunar caustic and does not prevent the
formation of an adherent eschar; but very severe
inflammation requires the application of the cold poultice
and lotion over the wound, and it is necessary to watch for
the period when an eschar may be attempted with the lunar
caustic. This a little experience will readily teach.</p>

<p>It is further to be particularly observed that the
inflammation attendant on a recent wound is removed by the
caustic, when the same degree of inflammation at a later
period, and with suppuration, would be aggravated and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>require the cold poultice and lotion, and render the
formation of an adherent eschar impossible. This fact, the
result of much experience, is extremely interesting, and, I
think, not easy to be explained. It is illustrated by the
following case.</p>

<br />

<h4 class="sc">Case XIX.</h4>

<p>Robert Hill, aged 16, received a blow yesterday from a bone
which was thrown at him, upon the outer condyle of the
humerus. He complains of extreme pain and there are much
redness and swelling. I applied the lunar caustic <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>and
directed the part to be exposed to the cold air.</p>

<p>On the succeeding day, I found that the eschar was quite
adherent, and that the pain, redness and swelling had much
subsided, although there was some stiffness of the elbow.</p>

<p>On the third day there was still further amendment. From
this time no remedy or attention was required.</p>

<br />

<h4 class="sc">Case XX.</h4>

<p>It frequently occurs to surgeons to receive slight wounds
upon the hands <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>which prove very troublesome. Of this kind
is the following.</p>

<p>Mr. L.C. had an irritable and inflamed sore on the ulnar
side of the third finger, occasioned by a bruise a fortnight
ago. Many applications had been made during this fortnight
but the sore had no disposition to heal. I applied the lunar
caustic to form an adherent eschar.</p>

<p>From this time the pain and inflammation subsided. The
eschar remained firm and adherent, and in six days separated
leaving the wound healed.</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span><br />

<h4>III. ON ULCERS.</h4>

<p>From the preceding observations it would naturally be
concluded that the lunar caustic would afford a remedy for
the treatment of ulcers. This conclusion is perfectly just.
Yet there are many circumstances which render the mode of
treating ulcers by the caustic, efficacious or the contrary.</p>

<p>In order that the treatment by eschar may be successful,
there must be the following conditions in regard to the
ulcer: first, the surface occupied by the ulcer must not be
too extensive; <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>secondly, it must not be exposed to much
motion or friction; and thirdly, it must not be attended by
a profuse discharge; for all these circumstances have a
direct effect in, preventing the formation of an adherent
eschar or of removing it if formed.</p>

<p>I observe, therefore, that I have not found the mode of
treatment by eschar to succeed in large ulcers of the legs.
But in small ulcers, and especially in those irritable and
painful little ulcers which are so apt to form about the
ankle and occasionally occur near, the tendo achillis, and
in which Mr. Baynton's plan is inadmissible, the caustic is
invaluable; <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>in these cases the cold poultice and lotion
should precede the application of the caustic, for a few
days, that the irritability and inflammation of the sore and
surrounding skin may be first subdued; and after the eschar
is formed, the part must be kept exposed to the air and
defended from external injury, by enjoining the patient to
wear trowsers and to be careful not to disturb the eschar.</p>

<p>The plan of curing ulcers is exactly what has been described
in the treatment by the unadherent eschar. For in these
cases the eschar is generally unadherent at first. It is
necessary therefore in all cases, except those of <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>very
small ulcers, to examine the eschar, making a small puncture
or rather smooth incision in its centre, so as to evacuate
the subjacent fluid if there be any, taking great care not
to break down or bruise the eschar so as to leave its
inferior surface at all ragged. This operation should be
repeated daily until the eschar proves to be quite adherent.
And if the ulcer be rather large, rest should be enjoined
until the adherent eschar be fully and safely formed, and a
dose of saline purgative may be interposed. It must also be
particularly borne in mind, that the eschar must be
constantly defended by the gold-beater's skin, which must be
removed and reapplied at each examination.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>I have here spoken of ulcers upon the legs. But the same
observations apply to ulcers on other parts of the body, and
these are, in general, far more manageable than the former,
and do not require the same rest during the unadherent state
of the eschar.</p>

<br />

<h4 class="sc">Case XXI.</h4>

<p>Mrs. Butcher, aged 52, has two ulcers a little above the
outer ankle, one the size of half-a-crown, the other, of a
shilling, of four months duration, which are now in a
healing state by the application of cerate and poultice; the
healing process is going on very slowly. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>These ulcers were
caused by a fall which bruised the part but made no wound at
the time; two small spots, which she compared to the
pustules of small-pox, formed, broke, and gave rise to the
ulcers. I applied the lunar caustic to form eschars.</p>

<p>At this time I had not begun to defend the eschar by the
gold-beater's skin, and in consequence both these eschars
were torn by the patient's stocking having adhered to them,
and there was an oozing of fluid from the centre of each
eschar on examination on the following day. I again applied
the lunar caustic.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>On the succeeding day, I found that the large eschar had
again been disturbed, the patient having applied a little
linen, instead of leaving it exposed. I reapplied the lunar
caustic.</p>

<p>On the next day both eschars were complete, but there was a
little fluid under the centre of each, which required to be
evacuated by an incision. There was little inflammation or
pain.</p>

<p>On the following day, my patient expressed herself as
astonished at the rapid amendment. A little fluid was again
evacuated from beneath the centre of the eschar.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>On the next day the smaller eschar was quite adherent; under
the large one, there was still a very little fluid.</p>

<p>About the ninth day, both the eschars were perfectly
adherent. In two days afterwards the eschars began to
separate round the edges, and in a few days more, it was
necessary to remove the separating portion by the
scissors.&mdash;In the course of time the eschar separated
completely, leaving the ulcers healed.</p>

<p>Mrs. Butcher had no pain after the first four days from the
application of the caustic, and in a week was able to attend
to her household affairs.</p>

<br />

<h4 class="sc"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>Case XXII.</h4>

<p>J. Copeland, blacksmith, aged 38, came to me with many deep
ulcerations, from the size of a horse bean to that of a pea,
attended with great pain, heat, itching and excoriations of
the surrounding skin, obliging him to rest at different
times, for several days together. These ulcers came without
any apparent cause, have continued for many weeks, and have
only been a little benefitted by rest, although he has
applied many kinds of ointment, the last consisting of equal
parts of mercurial and of the tar ointment. I applied <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>the
lunar caustic upon each ulcer, but not over the excoriation,
and I enjoined the patient to leave the whole exposed to
dry.</p>

<p>On the following day, I was gratified to find that eschars
had formed upon every ulcer; upon examination, a little
fluid was found to subsist under several of the larger
eschars; this I evacuated, and I then applied the lunar
caustic to the points from which it had issued to make up
the breach of continuity of the eschars over the surface of
the ulcers. There was far less inflammation and scarcely any
pain, and he has continued his occupation of blacksmith.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>On the third day nearly all the eschars were adherent;
three, however, had unfortunately been removed by an
accident; I renewed them by again applying the caustic.</p>

<p>In four days after the last report, most of the eschars had
separated from the smallest ulcers leaving the parts healed.</p>

<p>In a day or two more, my patient took cold and was affected
with hoarseness and cough, and the skin round the eschar
became excoriated a little. I directed a saline purgative
and applied the lunar caustic to the excoriated parts.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>On the succeeding day his cold was better and the eschars
adherent. I directed five grains of the Plummer's pill to be
taken night and morning, which he continued about a week.</p>

<p>Five days after this period, I again observed a disposition
to excoriate. I applied the caustic.</p>

<p>In two days more, the eschars were adherent, and there was
no further appearance of excoriation.</p>

<p>In ten more days, the eschars had separated and all the
ulcers and excoriations were completely healed.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>This case occurred several years ago, and there has been no
return of the affliction whatever.</p>

<br />

<h4 class="sc">Case XXIII.</h4>

<p>Mr. Marshall, aged 60, had a troublesome ulcer under the
outer ankle, of an oblong form and of the size of sixpence.
He has been long subject to ulcers of the legs, and he had a
similar ulcer to the present one in the same situation, some
years ago, which proved extremely difficult to heal under
usual remedies. The veins are varicose.&mdash;From the small size
of the ulcer, I applied the lunar caustic and protected the
eschar by the gold-beater's skin.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>On the following day, I found the eschar complete but
unadherent by the effusion of a little fluid; this I
evacuated daily in the manner already described, for about a
fortnight, when the eschar became adherent.</p>

<p>During the progress of the cure a little excoriation formed
round the eschar. I touched the parts with the caustic, and
the eschar thus formed served to support that formerly made,
and so to do good. The whole adhered until the sore was very
nearly healed; but as it was situated in a part greatly
exposed, it was removed by accident. The caustic was again
applied; fluid formed underneath <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>the eschar as before and
required evacuating thrice; but at length the eschar
adhered, and in due time separated leaving the ulcer quite
healed.</p>

<p>The same patient has since been affected by similar ulcers
at different times in different parts of the leg. He applied
early and they were each time easily cured by one
application of the caustic. He has also twice had injuries
upon the shin, which were readily cured in the same manner.</p>

<br />

<h4 class="sc">Case XXIV.</h4>

<p>The following case must not be regarded as altogether
trifling. For such <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>sores are very apt to spread and to
remain long very troublesome.</p>

<p>An old gentleman came to me with an oblong ulcer on the shin
about an inch in length; it was very painful and inflamed. I
applied the lunar caustic to form an eschar and requested
him to call on the following morning. He did not come,
however, but on seeing him the next day it was requisite to
evacuate a little fluid; this was repeated on they third
day, after which period the eschar remained adherent, and
the part totally free from pain.</p>

<p>The eschar separated in about three weeks leaving the part
healed.</p>

<br />

<h4 class="sc"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>Case XXV.</h4>

<p>The following case illustrates the superior efficacy of the
lunar caustic over the ordinary modes of treatment in some
ulcers of the legs, and will, I trust, be found particularly
interesting.</p>

<p>Mr. G.B. aged 60, a very tall and stout person, had two
ulcers, one of the size of a shilling upon the back of the
leg just above the tendo achillis, the other rather less, on
the outside of the leg; they were caused by his scratching
the parts severely three months before; and he had used
various remedies in the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>interval. There were some &oelig;dema
of the leg to which he is subject, and much pain and
inflammation of the ulcers. I directed the application of a
cold poultice and lotion, and prescribed the pil. hydrarg.
every second night with an aperient draught the following
morning.</p>

<p>This plan of treatment was continued for a number of days
without any appearance of healing in the ulcers. As the
inflammation had subsided I proposed to adopt the mode of
treatment recommended by Mr. Baynton, fearing that any
attempt to heal the ulcers by eschar would fail on account
of the &oelig;dema. This project was deferred, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>however, by the
patient's wish to try the effect of sea-bathing. After a
month's residence on the sea shore I was, on the return of
my patient, again requested to examine these ulcers, which I
found very nearly in the same state as before, only with the
addition of some excoriations. I recommended the cold
poultice for a few days to allay inflammation, and then
tried Mr. Baynton's plan, dressing the leg myself daily; on
the fourth day, however, the sore above the tendo achillis
became so irritable that I was compelled to desist and to
remove the plaster and bandage, and I again directed the
cold poultice with rest, for a few days.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>When the inflammation had again subsided, I ventured,
notwithstanding the &oelig;dema, to apply the lunar caustic to
form an eschar, enjoining rest and the horizontal position.</p>

<p>On the following day complete but unadherent eschars were
formed over each sore. There, had been no pain after the
smart of the caustic had ceased. On carefully making an
incision into the centre of each eschar, a little fluid was
evacuated.</p>

<p>On the second day, rather more fluid was evacuated in the
same manner. There was a little more inflammation round the
eschar than yesterday.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>On the third day the sores were exactly in the same state.
On the fourth, the patient having used his leg a little,
rather more fluid was evacuated from the centre, and there
was rather more inflammation round the edges, of the
eschars. I enjoined the strictest rest.</p>

<p>On the fifth day, there were less inflammation and
discharge.</p>

<p>From this day until the tenth the fluid required daily
evacuation; the eschar became adherent, and I allowed my
patient to walk about.</p>

<p>In about six weeks the eschar was nearly separated and I
removed it by <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>the scissors, leaving only a portion adherent
of the size of a pea. It had been prevented from being
removed from the beginning, by the gold-beater's skin. The
smaller eschar had dropped off leaving the ulcer quite
healed. In a week more the last portion of eschar separated
from the larger sore, leaving it also quite well.</p>

<br />

<h4 class="sc">Case XXVI.</h4>

<p>The following case occurred in the person of a lady with
varicose veins and far advanced in pregnancy. Its speedy
cure by the caustic was, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>therefore, the more remarkable,
and saved her much trouble and suffering.</p>

<p>Mrs. C. aged 40, had two small irritable and inflamed
ulcers, under the inner ankle. I applied the lunar caustic
to form an eschar.</p>

<p>It was requisite to evacuate a little fluid from under the
eschars for three successive days; they then remained
adherent.</p>

<p>About the usual time the eschars separated, leaving a small
point of the size of a pin's head, unhealed; this I again
touched with the caustic. The case required no further
attention.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>This case leads me to caution my readers always to examine
the parts carefully after the separation of the eschars, and
if there be the slightest ulcer remaining to apply the
caustic to it.</p>

<br />

<h4 class="sc">Case XXVII.</h4>

<p>Mrs. Wakefield, aged 36, had an extensive ulceration with
excoriation on the upper part of the right breast, of two
months continuance; it had been greatly aggravated by
improper treatment. I applied the lunar caustic over the
whole ulcerated and excoriated surface. It gave much pain.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>On the following day I was concerned to find that part of
the eschar had been separated by the patient's dress. I
repeated the application of the caustic and again directed
the part to be exposed and carefully protected from being
disturbed. The breast required to be supported being full of
milk.</p>

<p>On the succeeding day an adherent eschar existed over all
the ulcerated parts, and the pain, redness, and irritation
had nearly subsided.</p>

<p>On the fourth day there was still less pain and
inflammation. On the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>eight the eschars had separated and
the breast was quite well.</p>

<br />

<h4 class="sc">Case XXVIII.</h4>

<p>Mrs. U. aged 60, has been subject to ulcerated legs for
several years. She has one ulcer on the outer ankle of the
size of a shilling, and another behind it of the size of a
horse-bean; they have been extremely troublesome and under
surgical treatment for the last year, but during the last
few weeks she has tried cerate, poultice, and the cold
lotion. The leg is much swollen and inflamed, the redness
extending several inches round the wound and over the
instep; <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>the &oelig;dema increases towards night. She has been
in the habit of taking saline purgatives frequently.</p>

<p>I directed my patient to continue the cold poultice and
lotion, and to rest completely for several days. At this
period, the inflammation having somewhat abated, I applied
the lunar caustic to form eschars and protected the parts
with gold-beater's skin.</p>

<p>On the following day there was a slight increase of redness
round the eschars. Upon making an incision into their centre
some fluid was evacuated. The same report was made on each
of the two following days.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>On the seventh day, the eschars having been neglected, fluid
had escaped from beneath the eschars at their edges, and my
patient complained of more pain. A little more fluid escaped
in the same manner on the following day on making a little
pressure upon the eschars. I applied the caustic to make up
the breach.</p>

<p>Subsequently to this day there was an increase of
inflammation. From this circumstance, and from the neglect
of the eschars for two or three days already mentioned, I
suspected the formation of a scab under them. It was
impossible to pierce the eschars by the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>penknife without
breaking them, as they had become too hard and thick by
delay and the addition of the scab.</p>

<p>I again directed the cold poultice for four or five days. On
examining the wounds on the separation of the eschars, I
found the healing process going on. I reapplied the lunar
caustic to form eschars, and I evacuated a little fluid from
their centre for three successive days.</p>

<p>At this time the patient took cold and a smart attack of
fever came on, and the part round the eschars became much
inflamed. I prescribed an emetic <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>and purge, and a cold
poultice and lotion.</p>

<p>In the space of a week I again attempted to form an eschar
over the larger wound, for the smaller one had quite healed.</p>

<p>The next day I discharged a little fluid from the centre,
and again on the eight or nine succeeding days, giving
saline purgatives.</p>

<p>After this time the eschar remained adherent, and no further
remedy was required.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>This case is particularly interesting and important, as it
illustrates the plans to be adopted in two circumstances of
no unfrequent occurrence; 1. when there is an attack of
fever and increased inflammation, and 2. when a scab forms
underneath the eschar. In both cases we must relinquish our
attempt to form an adherent eschar for a time,&mdash;apply the
poultice,&mdash;and recur to the caustic in the course of a few
days.</p>

<p>In the beginning of my trials of the treatment of the ulcers
by the caustic, I was repeatedly betrayed by the smooth
appearance of the eschar, to think that all was going on
well, when in fact a <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>scab was all along forming underneath.
In these cases inflammation soon followed, and it was only
by carefully and daily evacuating the fluid effused under
the eschar that I at length succeeded in effecting an
adherent eschar free from surrounding inflammation. This
remark cannot be too often repeated.</p>

<br />

<h4 class="sc">Case XXIX.</h4>

<p>The peculiarity of the present case arose from neglect in
evacuating the fluid effused under the eschar the day
succeeding its formation, the consequence of which was that
the edges of the eschar became raised all round, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>without
however being entirely detached.</p>

<p>Mr. Draper, aged 50, had a small irritable ulcer of the size
of a horse-bean, upon the shin, of a month's duration, with
surrounding inflammation to the extent of several inches. I
applied the lunar caustic to form an eschar and protected it
with gold-beater's skin.</p>

<p>On the following day, it appeared from the flatness of the
surface, that the eschar was adherent; the inflammation
remained as before.</p>

<p>On the next day the eschar was raised all round its borders,
presenting <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>the appearance of an elevated ring. I made an
opening in one point of this ring by a penknife and
evacuated the fluid, and I again applied the caustic all
round in order to give firmness to the edges of the eschar.</p>

<p>On the succeeding day an opening was made in the centre of
the eschar and a little more fluid was evacuated.</p>

<p>This mode of treatment was continued daily for about a week,
the inflammation gradually subsiding and the eschar becoming
adherent and corrugated. In about three weeks, the patient
thinking the sore quite well <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>detached the eschar; there was
still, however, a minute ulcer left, which was touched with
the caustic.</p>

<br />

<h4 class="sc">Case XXX.</h4>

<p>C. Cocking, aged 17, has an ulcer of the size of
half-a-crown on the inner part of the knee, occasioned by an
accident. He had been a month under surgical care in the
country when he applied to me, but the ulcer continued
without disposition to heal, and fungous; it had apparently
been treated by a solution of sulphate of copper. I applied
the lunar caustic over the surface of the sore and upon the
surrounding skin.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>On the following day, the eschar was unadherent and puffy,
and on piercing it a little fluid escaped. The incision into
the eschar was repeated three or four successive days, but
the eschar still retained its puffy character; I therefore
directed a poultice to be applied to remove it.</p>

<p>In two days the eschar was separated leaving the ulcer with
its fungous appearance. I removed the fungous part by
scissors, and directed the poultice to be applied and to be
continued for two days. I then formed another eschar. This
required a daily puncture for the evacuation of subjacent
fluid, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>for six days; it then remained adherent, and in
about a fortnight it separated leaving the ulcerated surface
healed. This patient was not at all confined.</p>

<br />

<h4 class="sc">Case XXXI.</h4>

<p>Mr. S. aged 30, had a sore two inches in length in the
groin, the remains of a phagedenic ulcer. It had remained
stationary a whole fortnight under the ordinary treatment by
bandage. I applied the lunar caustic to form an eschar and
then the gold-beater's skin.</p>

<p>The day afterwards, I found the eschar incomplete and I
applied the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>caustic again. The eschar was still incomplete
on the following day, and the caustic was again required to
be applied to the denuded parts.</p>

<p>On examination two days afterwards I found the eschar
complete and adherent.</p>

<p>On the fourth following day, great part of the eschar had
separated leaving the ulcer healed, and I had no occasion to
see the patient again.</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span><br />

<h4>IV. OF SOME ANOMALOUS CASES.</h4>

<p class="cen">1. <i>Of Whitlow.</i></p>

<p>The lunar caustic is very useful in the treatment of this
painful affection. Patients seldom apply to the surgeon
before suppuration has taken place. It is then, I think, the
best plan to open the abscess freely, to apply the caustic
well within the cavity, and then to envelope the part by the
cold poultice and lotion. In this manner the pain and
irritation are almost immediately removed, after the smart
of the caustic has subsided. A second application is <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>seldom
necessary. In some cases, however, there is an increase of
inflammation in a day or two, which requires the caustic to
be again applied. When the inflammation has subsided, the
loose cuticle may be removed, and the caustic must be
applied to form an eschar.</p>

<p>In slight cases the lunar caustic may be passed over the
inflamed part, and in this manner suppuration and the
continuance of inflammation is often prevented.</p>

<p>In those cases in which the suppuration is artificial and
attended with <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>severe diffused inflammation, the pus should
be evacuated and a cold poultice applied for a day or two;
for the too early application of the caustic would only add
to this kind of inflammation; <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><a href="#Page_11">see p. 11</a>;</span> afterwards the skin
may be removed, and if there be excoriations the caustic may
be lightly applied.</p>

<p class="cen">2. <i>Of Inflammation of the Finger.</i></p>

<p>The following case of inflammation of the finger occurred
without any assignable cause.</p>

<br />

<h4 class="sc">Case XXXI.</h4>

<p>A young man, aged 18, came to me with a painful swelling of
the middle <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>finger of the right hand; suspecting deep-seated
abscess, I made a free incision and evacuated a little pus.
I then applied the lunar caustic within the cavity and
directed a cold poultice to be applied with lotion.</p>

<p>On the fourth day my patient had returned to his occupation
as a dyer.</p>

<br />

<h4 class="sc">Case XXXII.</h4>

<p>Miss B. aged 23, had a slight scratch on the inside of the
index finger, which issued in severe inflammation extending
over the back of the hand. I made a free incision in the
part first affected, evacuated a little pus, and directed a
poultice to be applied.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>On the following day, there was less pain but still great
swelling at the back of the hand, which, I think, would have
been removed had the caustic been used.</p>

<p>I now applied the caustic freely within the orifice.</p>

<p>On the following day there was less swelling and discharge.</p>

<p>Two days afterwards, the caustic was again applied, and in
eight days from the first application of the caustic the
hand was quite well.</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span><br />

<p class="cen">3. <i>Of Fungous Ulcer of the Navel in Infants.</i></p>

<p>It sometimes occurs that a little fungous sore exists upon
the navel in infants which is difficult of cure in the
ordinary way. I had one case which had subsisted for two
years, and another, which had continued for two months, and
were, during those periods, a source of great trouble and
uneasiness to the mothers of the little patients. These
ulcers are easily cured in the following manner.</p>

<p>The fungus is to be completely removed by a pair of
scissors, and when the bleeding has quite ceased, the lunar
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>caustic is to be applied, and the part defended by the
gold-beater's skin and kept carefully from any moisture.</p>

<p>In one of the cases mentioned above the eschar was
accidentally separated twice and required to be renewed; but
both cases were cured in the space of a few days.</p>

<br />

<p class="cen">4. <i>Of Inflammation of the Knee.</i></p>

<p>Servant women, I suspect from much kneeling in scouring
stairs, &amp;c. are subject to a species of inflammation of the
knee which is frequently extremely troublesome.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>In one case suppuration of the integuments took place in the
forepart of the knee, and the patient was obliged to leave
her situation and go to her friends at a distance, although
every antiphlogistic means was tried for her relief.</p>

<p>In two other cases, after the application of twenty leeches
and the administration of an emetic and purgative medicine,
I applied the lunar caustic freely over the whole surface of
the knee previously moistened with water. In a few hours the
cuticle was raised and vesicated; I evacuated a viscid
puriform fluid, and I directed the constant application of
the cold poultice and lotion.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>In a few days all inflammation subsided and the patients
remained well.</p>

<p>These three cases having occurred to me at the same time,
and being apparently equally severe, I was enabled to judge
of the efficacy of this use of the caustic, and I can
strongly recommend it to a future and further trial. Its
application causes more pain than a blister, but not so much
as to form an obstacle to its employment.</p>

<p>It may not be unimportant, here, to suggest the trial of the
caustic in other cases of inflammation, in which a more than
usually active local remedy is required.</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span><br />

<p class="cen">5. <i>Of Tinea Capitis, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>In this place I have only to observe that I have in some
cases completely succeeded, in others completely failed, in
the cure of tinea capitis, by the lunar caustic. As I have
not hitherto distinguished these cases from each other; and
as I could only offer conjectures on the subject, I think it
best to leave it for future inquiry.</p>

<p>The same observation applies to some other cutaneous
affections which I need not specify more particularly at the
present.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III.<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">ToC</a></span></h3>

<h4>OF SOME CASES IN WHICH THE CAUSTIC IS INAPPLICABLE.</h4>
<br />

<p>It is by no means my intention to recommend the application
of the lunar caustic as an infallible remedy for all local
diseases. I am quite aware of the propensity, in
recommending a favourite remedy, to extend its use beyond
its true limits. The caustic, like all other remedies,
requires to be employed with discrimination; and it is
therefore my object in this little work, to state in which
cases it is, and in <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>which cases it is not, useful and
successful.</p>

<p>With this object, I have thought it not improper to add, in
a concluding chapter, some observations on those cases in
which I have found the lunar caustic to be inadmissible. It
will, at the same time, be found that such cases, in the
course of their treatment by the ordinary measures, not
unfrequently become fit cases for the application of the
caustic, with the view of more speedily completing the cure.</p>

<p>This observation is particularly applicable to the cases of
burns, of large ulcers, of fungous ulcers, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>The caustic is inapplicable in extensive lacerations, for
the same reason that it is so in extensive ulcers.</p>

<p>I have found the caustic of little use in incised wounds,
and should not employ it except in such wounds received in
dissection.</p>

<p>I have failed in my attempts to heal scrofulous sores by the
adherent eschar; I would propose the trial with the lunar
caustic and poultice.</p>

<p>In erysipelatous inflammation, where vesicles are formed,
the caustic does injury, as in recent burns.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>I have always found that the caustic has done injury in
boils, aggravating rather than diminishing the affection.</p>

<br />

<p class="cen">1. <i>Of Burns.</i></p>

<p>The application of the lunar caustic in recent burns or
scalds, has always appeared to me to increase the
inflammation and vesication, even inducing blisters where
there were none before. The caustic must not, therefore, be
applied in these cases, until the inflammation has entirely
subsided; but when there remains only a small superficial
ulceration, the caustic may be passed lightly over the
ulcerated <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>surface to form an eschar which is to be defended
by the gold-beater's skin; for the affection is then reduced
to the state of a common superficial ulcer. An adherent
eschar is generally readily formed, and no further
application is required. If the ulceration be more extensive
and deeper, the lunar caustic may be applied, and the eschar
treated, exactly as in common ulcers.</p>

<p>It may be well to illustrate these points, by the following
cases.</p>

<br />

<h4 class="sc">Case XXXIII.</h4>

<p>A little girl, aged 10, scalded her breast a week ago and
has treated it <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>with the ordinary remedies. There remained a
superficial ulceration of the size of half-a-crown. I
applied the lunar caustic lightly over the surface of the
sore, and then the gold-beater's skin.</p>

<p>On the following day, an adherent eschar had formed, and in
five days more it dropped off leaving the ulcer quite
healed.</p>

<br />

<h4 class="sc">Case XXXIV.</h4>

<p>Mr. C. aged 51, scalded his leg ten days ago on the instep.
He applied ointments and poultices. The surface remained
ulcerated to the extent of <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>three inches in length and an
inch and a half in breadth, and presented a considerable
thick slough in the centre; the inflammation continued to be
considerable with some &oelig;dema towards the toes. In such a
case I should now recommend a cold poultice to be applied
for several days; but the present case occurring early in my
trials of the caustic, the latter remedy was applied
forthwith over both the ulcer and slough.</p>

<p>On the following day I learnt that the pain after the
application of the caustic had been considerable for two
hours. It then ceased and the eschar became complete; and
there was rather <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>less inflammation and swelling. The
patient had kept in bed. I prescribed a pill with the
hydrarg. submurias, to be followed by an aperient draught.</p>

<p>On the succeeding day my patient went down stairs and
disturbed the eschar, and experienced more pain. The
inflammation and swelling were still less. I applied the
caustic to the parts of the ulcer exposed by the injury done
to the eschar.</p>

<p>During the two following days the inflammation subsided
entirely; I evacuated a little fluid from beneath the
eschar.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>On the next day the eschar appeared adherent, except in the
centre which was occupied by the slough.</p>

<p>On the succeeding day, I evacuated a little fluid from
beneath the slough.</p>

<p>On the next day I removed the slough entirely by means of a
pair of scissors. The subjacent ulcer had a healthy
granulated appearance. I applied the lunar caustic to it to
form an eschar.</p>

<p>From this time it was necessary to evacuate a little fluid
from under the eschar for ten successive days. It then
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>became adherent, and in about a fortnight it separated,
leaving the ulcer healed.</p>

<br />

<h4 class="sc">Case XXXV.</h4>

<p>The following case will present a specimen of my trials of
the lunar caustic in larger ulcers.</p>

<p>Anthony Knowles, aged 44, was kicked by a horse on the leg,
above the inner ankle, two years ago. The part has never
healed, but still remains in the state of an open ulcer,
attended by some inflammation. When I first saw this ulcer
it was about two inches in <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>diameter and nearly circular,
with high edges, a surface of a greenish colour, and without
any healthy granulations. I applied the lunar caustic to
form an eschar.</p>

<p>The pain from the caustic was severe for several hours. An
eschar had formed round the edges, but in the middle part it
was quite wanting; the inflammation surrounding the ulcer
had abated, and the green hue of its surface had
disappeared. I reapplied the caustic in the central part.</p>

<p>On the following day the eschar appeared tolerably complete
in the centre <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>but had separated at one part of the
circumference. I again applied the caustic to the defective
part.</p>

<p>On the following day the eschar was defective in several
parts, but the inflammation was quite removed, there was no
pain, and there had been less smarting after each successive
application of the caustic. I again applied the caustic.</p>

<p>On the succeeding day, I learnt that my patient had been
intoxicated, and I found the ulcer attended by inflammation.
The eschar was by no means complete; some part of it was in
a <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>detached state. I removed the loose portions and repeated
the application of the caustic.</p>

<p>This sort of treatment was continued for a fortnight without
my being able to effect the formation of a complete eschar.
I therefore relinquished the idea of healing the ulcer by
the adherent eschar; I eventually succeeded in doing so by
applying the caustic every third day and the poultice
continually, and I had hopes that the cure might be
permanent, but he made application to me in two years
afterwards with a similar ulcer on the same part.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>In another similar case, I removed the elevated hard edges
of the ulcer by the lancet, and then tried the caustic,
without better success.</p>

<br />

<h4 class="sc">Case XXXVI.</h4>

<p>The last case I have to give is one of great interest, as it
clearly shows the influence of the lunar caustic in subduing
the inflammation surrounding ulcerations, and in promoting
the healing process, even in cases of phagedenic ulcer. In
such cases its influence eminently deserves a still further
trial.</p>

<p>Mrs. H. aged 56, has had very extensive phagedenic
ulcerations on the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>legs and thighs during three years,
which began in little red spots and then spread rapidly,
destroying the integuments. One of these ulcers, on the
thigh, was twelve inches in length and five in breadth, and
exhibited the appearance of a deep corroding furrow; it was
surrounded by a fiery redness and was attended by extreme
pain. There were many other ulcers of the same kind, several
nearly of the same magnitude; and the poor patient was
compelled to take large doses of laudanum several times in
the day. She had formerly been treated for syphilis, and had
afterwards taken the sarsaparilla freely; amongst a great
variety of local <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>applications, the white bread poultice had
afforded most relief.</p>

<p>I applied the lunar caustic to two of the smaller ulcers.</p>

<p>On the following day the eschars were complete. I applied
the caustic to the large sore above described to the extent
of three inches square, avoiding its application on the
inflamed skin.</p>

<p>On the next day I found the eschar last made complete, and I
passed the caustic over the ulcer to the extent of three
inches more.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>On the succeeding day, the eschar was complete, adherent at
those edges which adjoined the cuticle, and floating at the
other edges over the ulcer, and in the latter part allowing
the escape of matter; round the adherent edges of the eschar
the inflammation had entirely disappeared, while it remained
fiery as before round every other part of the ulcer.</p>

<p>I continued my trials with the caustic in this case, but it
gave so much pain, and I had so little hope of final
success, that I altogether relinquished the attempt to treat
these ulcers by eschar. Some of the small ulcers <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>were
healed, however, and the larger one assumed a more healthy
character wherever the caustic had been applied. It may,
therefore, remain a question whether the lunar caustic may
not still prove useful in phagedenic ulcers of a smaller
size.</p>
